          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            ABSENCE-in its 20th year of publication by Penn State Greater Allegheny-
            is an annual review of the best literary and visual art made by students,
	    staff, faculty, and alums of the campus each academic year. ABSENCE is 
	    published each April, and is available for teh first time in paper at an 
	    annual "Celebration of the Arts: A Reading and Reception," which features
	    the creative work of each year's authors and artists. Acceptance for 
	    publication by the student editors is selective and competetive, holding 
	    at a rate of 20 to 25% since 2006.
	  <p>
	    Student editors have the opportunity to earn as many as 8 hours of Penn 
	    State academic credit while working to produce ABSENCE by enrolling in 
	    English 209: Journal or Magazine Practicum (offered during the Fall or 
	    Spring semester).
	  <p>
	    Yearly publication of ABSENCE is sponsored by the Office of the 
	    Chancellor, Academic Affairs, Admissions and Enrollment Management, 
	    Development, the Student Activity Fee, Student Affairs, and by individual 
	    faculty and staff contributions.

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            The Mission of ABSENCE is the annual publication of a high-quality 
	    literary and visual arts review for the Penn State Greater Allegheny 
	    community. The review's goal is to provide all full- and part-time 
	    PSUGA students, faculty, staff, and alumni a shared venue for their 
	    creative endeavors, and to generate interest in the arts in the Greater 
	    Allegheny community. The review also provides students professional 
	    opportunities to prepare for careers as editors in publishing-whether 
	    academic or trade, journal or book, paper or Web-and document/graphic 
	    design. Past staff editors have gone on to work in publishing or on to 
	    various graduate/professional studies.
